# untilIdentityChanged

In addition to specify that a certain condition must be met (like you can with `inState` or `condition()`), 
you can express with `untilIdentityChanged` that a following block is active until a certain property of a state has changed. 
Let's take a look at a concrete example to understand `untilIdentityChanged` better.

Let's say your app has a "master-detail" UI.
Think of something like an email client that has on the left a list of all emails where you can select an email from to then see the full email body on the right of the screen:

![master-detail](../images/email-master-detail.jpg)

```kotlin
data class InboxState(
    val emails : List<Email>
    val selectedEmail : SelectedEmail?
)

data class SelectedEmail(
    val emailId : Int, 
    val details : EmailDetails?
)
```

```
spec {
    inState<InboxState> {
        onEnter { loadEmails() }
        on<EmailSelected> { action, state -> state.mutate {
            copy(selectedEmail = SelectedEmail(
                    emailId = action.selectedEmail.id,
                    details = null
                ))
            } 
        }

        untilIdentityChanged({ state -> state.selectedEmail?.emailId }) {
            // this block will be canceled and restarted whenever emailId changes
            onEnter { state -> 
                val s = state.snapshot
                if (s.selectedEmail != null) {
                    val details = loadEmailDetails(s.selectedEmail.emailId)
                    state.mutate { 
                        copy(selectedEmail = selectedEmail.copy(details = details))
                    }
                } else {
                    state.noChange()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The important bit to note is that `untilIdentiyChanged` is that it still works with the surounding condition.
In this example it means that while the state machine is in the `InboxState`.
The `untilIdentityChanged{...}` block also "starts" immediately and keep track of the "identity" of the state. 
In the example above the identity is the id of the selected email. 
Whenver the id of the selected email changes then whatever is inside the `untilIdentityChanged{...}` block will be canceled and restarted with the changed state. 
In our example it means that the `onEnter{...}` block gets canceled if a new email is selected and the `onEnter{...}` is started but this time with another email id for the selected email.

Depending on your use case, maybe [ExecutionPolicy](11_ExecutionPolicy.md) or [hierarchical state machines](13_composing-statemachines.md) can achieve the same or are even better suited.
