# ExecutionPolicy

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you would execute `Action` very fast 1 after another?
For example:

```kotlin
spec {
    inState<FooState> {
        on<BarAction> { action, state : State<FooState> ->
            delay(5000) // wait for 5 seconds
            state.override { OtherState() }
        }
    }
}
```

The example above shows a problem with async. state machines like FlowRedux:
If our state machine is in `FooState` and a `BarAction` got triggered, we wait for 5 seconds and then set the state to another state.
What if while waiting 5 seconds (i.e. let's say after 3 seconds of waiting) another `BarAction` gets
triggered.
That is possible, right?
With `ExecutionPolicy` you can specify what should happen in that case.
There are three options to choose from:

- `CANCEL_PREVIOUS`: **This is the default one automatically applied unless specified otherwise.** It would cancel any previous execution and just run the latest one. In the example mentioned it means the previous still running `BarAction` handler gets canceled and a new one with the laster `BarAction` starts.
- `UNORDERED`: Choosing this causes all the blocks to continue running but there are no guarantees in which order. For example:

    ```kotlin
    spec {
        inState<FooState> {
            on<BarAction>(executionPolicy = FlapMapPolicy.UNORDERED) { _, state : State<FooState> ->
                delay(randomInt()) // wait for some random time
                state.override { OtherState }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Let's assume that we trigger `BarAction` two times.
    We use random amount of seconds for waiting.
    Since we use `UNORDERED` as policy `on<BarAction>` the handler block gets executed 2 times without canceling the previous one (that is the difference  to `CANCEL_PREVIOUS`).
    Moreover, `UNORDERED` doesn't make any promise on order of execution of the block (see `ORDERED` if you need promises on order).
    If `on<BarAction>` gets executed two times it will run in parallel and the the second execution
    could complete before the first execution (because using a random time of waiting).

- `ORDERED`: In contrast to `UNORDERED` and `CANCEL_PREVIOUS`, `ORDERED` will not run `on<BarAction>` in parallel and will not cancel any previous execution. Instead, `ORDERED` will preserve the order.

`on<Action>` and `collectWhileInstate()` can specify an `ExecutionPolicy`:

- `on<Action>(executionPolicy = ExecutionPolicy.CANCEL_PREVIOUS) { ... }`
- `collectWhileInState(executionPolicy = ExecutionPolicy.CANCEL_PREVIOUS) { ... }`

Please note that `onEnter` doesn't have the option to specify `ExecutionPolicy`.
