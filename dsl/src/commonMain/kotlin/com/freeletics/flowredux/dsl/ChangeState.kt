/**
 * Represents a state transition.
 * Either use
 *  - [MutateState] to mutate the current state. You get a lambda block with the current state as input and expects
 *  the next state as output.
 * - [OverrideState] to trigger a transition from one state to the next one by simply overriding whatever state was
 * there before. Be careful using this especially if you have handle multiple actions or collect flows within the same
 * state as it really overrides the full state and you may loose information or partial state changes triggered by them.
 * Use [MutateState] in that case.
 * - [NoStateChange] to indicate that this function did not change the state at all. There should be only very little
 * use case for [NoStateChange]. So only use it if you actually know what you do.
 *
 * [ChangeState] doesnt allow you to directly access any property.
 * Then you may wonder how do you write unit test for one of your functions that return a [ChangeState]?
 * You need to call [ChangeState.reduce] to get the actual result of the change state.
